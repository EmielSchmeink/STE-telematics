# StratViz Web Application - Server
This part of the STE-Telematics project relates to the back-end of the interactive data visualization web application. This back-end is created using JS and Socket.io as back-end server technology.

## Getting Started
If you do not have the Node.js runtime installed yet, you can get the latest version from "https://nodejs.org/en/"<br>
Once Node is installed, open a terminal window in the client folder.<br>
Run the command `npm install`, this should install all external libraries and dependencies for the client. <br>

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm dev`<br>
Runs the server.js code, opening a socketio server at port 3001. Changes to code are automatically applied to the server and active connections refreshed.
