# StratViz Web Application - Client
This part of the STE-Telematics project relates to the interactive data visualization web application. This Web-app is created using React JS as front-end framework and Socket.io to connect to the back-end server technology.

## Getting Started
If you do not have the Node.js runtime installed yet, you can get the latest version from "https://nodejs.org/en/".<br>
Once Node is installed, open a terminal window in the `client` folder.<br>
Run the command `npm install`, this should install all external libraries and dependencies for the client. <br>

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`<br>
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`<br>
Launches the interactive test suite, found in the `src/test` folder.

`npm run build`<br>
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
The build is minified and is ready for deployment. 

It is recommended to install the React Developer Tool extension for chrome/firefox, as it allows you to easily inspect components, states, props, etc. "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en"
